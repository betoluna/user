/**
 * This plugInperforms a power law transformation on an image. Works on
 * 8‚Äêbit grayscale images.
 *
 * runaway.jpg: c = 1, gamma = 2.8, resulted in improved clarity and more contrast,  which resulted in a more balanced histogram.
 * changing values for c (e.g.0.5, 1.3) did not shield good results.
 * spine.jpg: gamma = 0.5 yield best results revealing more detail on the left darker side of the figure. Values above 1 were unuseful since 
 * the picture was darkened on the same side hiding more detail than the original. Other useful setting was to raise c to c = 1.3
 * and lower gamma to 0.7
 * My gamma is set to 2.2 which is the standard Mac OS gamma value setting. Still I will point out that the two halves of the
 * circle were not clearly seen, but instead they could be seen very faintly with the lighter gray half being slightly more perceptible.
 * I need to do more research to be able to describe how this effects my viewing in regards to my choice of gamma in my plugIn.
